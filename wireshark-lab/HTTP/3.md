### Screenshot
![screenshot](https://github.com/chaebum-kim/network-projects/blob/master/wireshark-lab/HTTP/screenshot1.jpg)
* When the requested file is long, the single HTTP response message is broken into several pieces by TCP,<br>with each piece being contained within a seperate TCP segment.
* The fact that the single HTTP response was fragmented across multiple TCP packet is indicated by<br> the "TCP segment of a reassembled PDU" in the Info column of the Wireshark display.
