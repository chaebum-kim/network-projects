|2|When your browser sends the HTTP GET message for the second time,<br>what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?|The "Authorization" field is included.|

### Authorization header
* The username and the password are encoded in the string of characters(d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRzOm5ldHdvcms=) in **Base64** format.
* You can decode the string in http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp
* If you decode the string, you'll get **wireshark-students:network**
* Since anyone can sniff packets using a program like Wireshark, simple passwords on WWW sites are not secure unless additional measures are taken.
